Description
===========

This plugin allows the Moodle administrator to define as many correction types as wanted (e.g. orthographic error, pronoun error, capitalization, etc.). Buttons in the Atto editor then allow users to make inline marks in texts.



Installation
============

1. Copy the plugin directory into the /lib/editor/atto/plugins/ directory of your Moodle installation.
2. Go through the standard Moodle plugin installation process.
3. Use the plugin's default settings or make up your own.
4. Go to http://your.moodle/admin/settings.php?section=editorsettingsatto and add a new line containing 'corr = writeup' (without the quotes). See http://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Text_editor#Toolbar_settings on how to fine tune Atto's toolbar to your liking.
